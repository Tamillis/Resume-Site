Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, and this is my website, resume and personal portfolio. 
It's here to display my various projects, passions and business information. 
Each page demonstrates particular skills, noted by the icons in the footer.

Feel free to inspect this HTML or check out the github repository to see how I put this site together.

People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing everyday. 
Well, hello there!
