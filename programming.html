      <h2 class="subtitle">So what's this about?</h2>
      <div class="main-text">
        <p>
          Over the years I've dabbled in various programming languages and environments. For me it started way back in
          sixth-form college where I took my first Computing class that used BASIC as its language of instruction and
          welcome into the wonderful world of computer programming. Within the (old) visual studio suite I learned first
          to make my fullscreen form flash random colours. It’s been my Hello World ever since.<br><br>
          I can’t say I’m an expert at any of the languages I use, I’ll let you be the judge of that, but I have managed
          to drag myself to a level of familiarity with Python, Java, C# and JavaScript in that order. Most recently
          I’ve put myself through a program of learning CSS and HTML, the product of which is what you see here. Nothing
          more than some static functionality along with some usage of server side files, but for now I’m proud of what
          I’ve managed to get together over the course of a month or so.<br><br>
          Below you will find iframes of my various other projects that I’m willing to let the wider world see, mostly
          in JavaScript and Java through the handy library of P5JS and Processing3. I’m afraid my old PyGame ventures
          from 16 year old me are lost to the void. Thankfully, haha. And maybe one of these days I’ll get around to
          finish the Brickbreak clone I was throwing together in C# and Monogame.<br><br>
          Anyway, here’s my showcase, if you have any questions regarding any of them in particular please feel free to
          click ‘query’ which will take you to a customised email which I have set up to a filter.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Randomly Coloring Tiles</h2>
      <p class="main-text">As noted, my first foray into something nearly always involves filling the screen with random
        colours. Like this.</p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <iframe class="frame" src="https://preview.p5js.org/Tamillis/embed/Os9tzE3r-" width="768" height="576"
          scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Smokey Wanderer</h2>
      <p class="main-text">This was another of the first forays into JavaScript, this time primarily to familiarise myself with array functions and make something pretty. Click to pause.</p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <iframe src="https://preview.p5js.org/Tamillis/embed/EJ8E8twVF" class="frame"  width="400" height="400"
        scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Boids</h2>
      <p class="main-text">Following along with Daniel Schiffman's videos I decided to implement the flocking algorithm, setting this up. It also makes use of DOM elements generated from inside the script that dynamically effect the simulation. Also they flee the mouse, which I thought was cute.</p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <iframe src="https://preview.p5js.org/Tamillis/embed/_zCa9LADT" class="frame"  width="400" height="500"
        scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Continent Generator</h2>
      <p class="main-text">One of these days I will get around to a full world generating program or, perhaps, some kind of zero player simulator of agents on a tiled world. For now, I busied myself with this generator that randomly creates continents using voronoi cells with a randomised distance function. Left and right arrow keys allow scrolling, to show that it is left-right wrappable. Click to generate a new set.</p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <iframe src="https://preview.p5js.org/Tamillis/embed/6j5IixBqc" class="frame"  width="400" height="400"
        scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Conways Life</h2>
      <p class="main-text">I love Conway's Life, so it was only a matter of time before I made it in P5JS. Here is that implementation. It also allows users to draw in new cells. P for pause and N for new set.</p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <iframe src="https://preview.p5js.org/Tamillis/embed/_f0BjwSbT" class="frame"  width="400" height="400"
        scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subtitle">No Overlap</h2>
      <p class="main-text">This particular sketch started as an attempt to explain recursion to a friend, and eventually into a packing algorithm challenge to myself, could I make one in less than the hour that I had before heading to work?<br>
      Of course not, but I did get the bulk of it done, and I polished it up to the state seen within the same day. Keep clicking and the balls will get smaller. It's probably my only properly commented program, haha.</p>
