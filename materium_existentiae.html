      <div class="main-text">
        <p>The Materium Existentiae is a world I've been working on for quite a while, adding bits coninuously here and there. It is the kitchen sink fantasy setting for my home games while also being unique and interesting in its own way, or at least I hope that it is!</p>
        <p>The setting splits the so-called material plane into country sized chunks of earth known as "Shards" which float in a hostile roiling soup known simply as the "Mists" which, as not so subtley implied by the name, are heavily inspired by the book and film of the same name.</p>
        <p>Each shard is a miniature world unto itself, with it's own unique collection of cultures and history, though all collectively pulling on an ancient pre-calamity history and a common cosmos, itself heavily inspired by the implied setting of Dungeons & Dragons (particularly fifth edition), but still it's own kettle of fish.</p>
        <p>This page is intended to be a depository of all sorts of player and GM oriented articles and sections for the various places, figures and stories of the world.</p>
        <p>The database part of that, and the search bar functionality, and frankly everything, is very much a work in progress.</p>
