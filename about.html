            <p>
                Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, as you might have already seen on the landing page's terminal sketch, and
                I'm a career English teacher, amateur (hopefully soon to be professional!) programmer, web
                developer (with this site being proof of skill, a demo), language nerd (I speak Japanese fluently, Swedish conversationally and I'm working on French. Spanish and German have been flirted with too.), country hopper and massive
                Dungeons and Dragons geek (primarily in the role as forever-DM, please let me know if you need a player!!).</p>

            <p>
                I’m 6ft tall, have been greying since I was 18, and hail from the rainy island of Great Britain. I currently teach English as a
                secondary language in the northern island of Hokkaido in Japan, as well as doing translation various other odd jobs
                here and there to do with languages or computers, or both. Teaching is one of my passions, and what I have done since graduation from Royal Holloway University of London where I studied Physics at an undergraduate level. </p>
            <p>
                I’m aware that my focus
                is pretty scattered, but I like to consider myself a generalist able to tackle and take on any kind of task and
                excel.</p>

            <p>At least that’s what I write on my CV!</p>

            <p>If you have any questions or enquiries, please feel free to contact me via the menu's contact e-mail link or <a href="skype:p.t.bellaby?userinfo" class="intext-link" target="_blank">here</a> on Skype or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peter.bellaby" class="intext-link" target="_blank">here</a> on Facebook.</p>

                Thank you for taking the time to check out the site and this about page.

                A Trinity College London TESOL certificate for teaching English as a foreign language,
                received from Universal Language Training, a 6 month course condensed into the busiest 1 month of my life. Well worth it, however, and it sparked my passion for teaching. (July 2015)</p>

                A Certificate of Higher Education in Physics from Royal Holloway University of London’s physics department. (September 2012 – June 2015)</p>

        <p class="subtitle-synopsis">The skills and abilities I bring to a table that haven't been printed on a paper first.</p>
        <div class="main-text">
            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Languages</span> I hold a fluent level of Japanese (JLPT N1 level equivilent) and a B1+
                (CEFR) level in Swedish (although to be brutally honest it's been a while, though I'm confident I could get it back up there, if not B2, within a month's serious study), a growing understanding of French as well as a foundational understanding of Spanish and German, though I confess not the ability to converse. Yet.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Programming, IT & Computer Skills</span>, where I am capable of coding in Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Basic, Python, C#, as well as quickly picking up any other 3rd generation programming language (one day I will look at C, promise). I am or will be fluent in any spreadsheet and word processing software you throw at me, at making use of Windows 7, 10 and now 11, with Linux (primarily Ubuntu and Arch based distros) and any other expected computer literacy. I also build computers as a hobby, and know them literally inside and out. Putting Lubuntu on an old Windows S

                <span class="inline-subtitle">Team worker</span>. No position is an island entire of itself. Proactive teamwork is key and I have always tried to be a good pillar. I have received excellent feedback during the summer English Language camps I have run, my positions as trainer and team leader, and in a variety of different fields from not just teaching, but team translation projects, event faires and as an Events Assistant during my hotel years. Not just working in teams, but building them up to get a job done too; I helped get Co&Co's 
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Time management</span>

                as demonstrated whilst juggling a part time job with University study and work-loads and organising
                classes
                and schedules for my students, I know what to do, how to do it, and most importantly how long things
                take. I
                am also not afraid to be upfront if I expect items are not possible within a certain schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Public liason experience</span>

                I worked as a waiter in a 5-star hotel for a year whilst studying, where I was unfailingly polite, and
                honed
                many other people and soft skills. I pride myself on my professional attitude in work, no matter what
                capacity I work in.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">General Aptitude</span>

                I have a wide base of skills to pull on and am capable of quickly and efficiently learning new skills or
                applying skills to new areas of work. I have a strong scientific background whilst also being capable in
                the
                humanities, where I have spent most of my working life.
