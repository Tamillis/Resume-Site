            <p>
                [Updated 9th February 2022]
            </p>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, as you might have already seen on the landing page's mock terminal: a career English teacher, a self-taught programmer and full stack web developer, a fluent speaker of English and Japanese and conversational in Swedish, a happily married man to a lovely wife, a world traveller (places I've been highlighted in red on the globe there) and a massive Dungeons and Dragons geek, primarily in the role as forever-DM (so please let me know if you need a player!) As you can probably see, I'm also a corgi owner and dog-person.</p>

            <p>
                I’m 6ft tall with blue eyes, have been greying since I was 18, and hail from the rainy island of Great Britain. I currently teach English as a secondary language in the northern island of Hokkaido in Japan, as well as doing translation and various other odd jobs here and there to do with languages or computers, or both. Teaching is one of my passions, and what I have done since completing a TESOL course after graduation from Royal Holloway University of London, where I studied Physics at an undergraduate level. </p>
            <p>
                I’m aware that my focus is pretty scattered, but I like to consider myself a generalist able to tackle and take on any kind of task and excel. At least that’s what I write on my CV!</p>

            <p>If you have any questions or enquiries, please feel free to contact me via the menu's contact e-mail link or <a href="skype:p.t.bellaby?userinfo" class="intext-link" target="_blank">here</a> on Skype or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peter.bellaby" class="intext-link" target="_blank">here</a> on Facebook.</p>

            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to check out the site and this about page.
            </p>
            <p>Nihil Supernum!</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Qualifications & Education</h2>
        <p class="subtitle-synopsis">The official certificates and education that I possess.</p>
        <div class="main-text">
            
            <p>An <span class="inline-subtitle">OCR Level 3 Diploma in Business Administration</span> during a commercial business apprenticeship with ZF Friedrichshafen AG, educated by Solihull College, where I developed a wide base of business skills alongside practical experience managing accounts of cart part manufacturing and supply for various big-names; Jaguar Landrover, Honda, Toyota and others.  (Oct 2017 – Oct 2018)</p>

            <p>A <span class="inline-subtitle">Trinity College London TESOL</span> certificate for teaching English as a foreign language, received from Universal Language Training, a 6 month course condensed into the busiest 1 month of my life. Well worth it, however, and it sparked my passion for teaching. (July 2015)</p>

            <p>A <span class="inline-subtitle">Certificate of Higher Education in Physics</span> from Royal Holloway University of London’s physics department. (September 2012 – June 2015)</p>

            <p>3 <span class="inline-subtitle">A-Levels</span> and an <span class="inline-subtitle">AS</span> at Solihull 6th Form College, which were; Physics – A, Mathematics – B, Computing – C, AS-Chemistry – C. (September 2010 – June 2012)</p>

            <p>And my primary education at Tudor Grange School, now Tudor Grange Academy, earning 14 GCSE’s including A*’s in Maths and English Literature, and A’s in English Language, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Statistics and Media Studies. (September 2005 – June 2010)</p>

            <p>For a complete list of my secondary education please contact me.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Personal Skills</h2>
        <p class="subtitle-synopsis">The skills and abilities I bring to a table that haven't been printed on a paper first.</p>
        <div class="main-text">
            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Languages</span>: I speak Japanese fluently, Swedish conversationally and I'm working on French. I hold a JLPT N1 level equivilent level of Japanese, conversing at a native level, and a B1+ (CEFR) level in Swedish (though it's been a while, I'm confident I could get it back up there, if not B2, within a month's serious study), a growing understanding of French as well as a foundational understanding of Spanish and German.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Programming, IT & Computer Skills</span>, where I am capable of coding in Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Basic, Python, C#, as well as quickly picking up any other 3rd generation programming language. I've learned the fundamentals of C++ to the point of building simple command-lind apps. I am or will be fluent in any spreadsheet and word processing and data-manipulation software you throw at me, at making use of Windows 7, 10 and now 11, with Linux (both Debian and Arch based distros) and any other expected computer literacy. I also build computers as a hobby, and know them literally inside and out. Putting Lubuntu on an old Windows Surface Pro was a fun project I underwent once.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Team Worker</span>. No position is an island entire of itself. Proactive teamwork is key and I have always tried to be a good pillar. I have received excellent feedback during the summer English Language camps I have run; my positions as trainer, team leader and teacher; and in a variety of different fields from not just teaching, but team translation projects, event faires and as an Events Assistant during my hotel years. Not just working in teams, but building them up to get a job done too; I helped get Co&Co's TOEIC Exam Preparation English course off the ground.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Project & Time Management</span>. As demonstrated while juggling a part time job with full-time intense University study and work-loads, and organising classes and schedules for my students, I know what to do, how to do it, and most importantly how long things take. I am also not afraid to be upfront if I expect items are not possible within a certain schedule, and I always priorities the completion of the project at hand to a level required by the specification, within dead-lines.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">Public liason experience</span>: I worked as a waiter in a 5-star hotel for a year and in various London-wide events as event staff while studying, where I was unfailingly polite, and honed many other people and soft skills. I pride myself on my professional attitude in work, no matter what capacity I work in, and my charming and approachable manner.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-subtitle">General Aptitude</span>: I have a wide base of skills to pull on and am capable of quickly and efficiently learning new skills or applying skills to new areas of work. I have a strong scientific background while also being capable and experienced in the humanities, where I have spent most of my working life. The power of a generalist is the ability to specialise anywhere.
